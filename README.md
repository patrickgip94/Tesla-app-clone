<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Tesla App-clone was inspired by the original Tesla App, which is a mobile application designed by Tesla for its customers. The app provides various features that allow Tesla owners to remotely control their vehicles and access real-time information about the car's status. The app was designed to offer convenience to Tesla customers and to make it easier for them to manage their vehicles. The Tesla App clone aims to replicate the same level of functionality and convenience as the original app, while also offering an alternative option for users who may not have access to the official app or prefer a different user interface.

*Future Project*
- Add more functionality (Controls, Location, Summon, and Security)
- Add Lock and Unlock Function
- Add Login & Sign Out function
